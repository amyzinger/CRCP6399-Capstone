This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Introductions: (1) A king looks for a wife and/or meets a clever girl by chance. (2) The father of the girl finds a golden mortar in a field and, against the advice of his clever daughter, takes it to the king who demands the pestle as well [H561.1.2]. (3) A quarrel between a farmer and a nobleman in court is settled by giving both riddles to be solved [H630'H659]. The daughter of the farmer gives the right answers [H561.1, H583.7, H583.9, H641.1, H631.3, H632, H633, H636, H583.8]. (4) A king finds a girl in a house. When he asks her about her relatives she answers with wit and cleverness. Main part: The clever girl has to perform various tasks set by the king [H373, H712, H1050'H1055, H1057, H1058, H1061'H1065, H1010, H1022.1, H1024.1, H1024.1.1, H1021.6.1, H1021.1, H1023.9, H1023.7, H1023.1, H951, J1191.2, H1152.1, H1185, H601]: she must come to the king neither naked nor clad, neither by horse nor on foot. She should estimate the value of the king's beard or weave a cloth with only a few threads. Or she has to make boiled eggs hatch [J1191.2, H1023.1.1] (cf. Type 821B) or carve a fowl and give appropriate pieces to all members of the family (cf. Type 1533). The king marries the girl [L162] but orders her not to meddle in his affairs. When he settles a dispute between two farmers unjustly, she advises the wronged man to show the king the absurdity of his decision by an equally foolish act [J1191.1]. When the king casts her out and allows her only to take with her the one thing she holds dearest [J1545.4], she takes her sleeping husband with her and thus moves him to forgive her.",The motifs of hatching boiled eggs and of sowing boiled seed probably come from Type 821B.,"This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 875A, 921, 922, and also 821B, 875B, 875D, 875E, 876, 879, 920, 920A, 958, and 1533.",103.0

On their way he finds an object (armband, belt, sword, shirt, etc.) which gives him supernatural strength [D840, D1335.5, D1335.4]. In a house of robbers (giants, other supernatural beings) the son defeats all of them (cf. Type 650A) until only one is left with whom his mother (secretly) starts a liaison [S12.1] (she marries him). In order to get rid of the son (the lover fears the son's strength) the mother feigns sickness and sends her son on a dangerous quest for a remedy [H931, H1211, H1212] (fruit [apple] from the garden of supernatural beings [H1333.3.1, H1333.3.1.1, H1333.3.1.3, D1364.4.1], water of life, animal's milk [H1361]) for which he must risk his life. The son returns successful and uninjured [F615, F615.2.1], accompanied by wild animals that have become his protectors [B315, B431.2, B520]. In numerous variants the boy rescues a young girl (princess [R111.1.1]) during one of his adventures and sends (brings) her back to her father, and/or he meets female helpers (old woman, a girl skilled in magic, his bride). The boy's mother asks him for the secret of his strength and steals it (ties him, gives him a narcotic drink, persuades him to take a bath) [K975, D861]. Then she (and/or her lover) blinds (murders) the boy. When he is blinded he is found by the princess, who nurses and restores his sight by observing how a blind animal is healed [B512]. When he is murdered he is resuscitated by one of his female helpers (using the remedies he procured). He recovers the object that holds his strength [D880] and takes revenge on his mother and her lover (kills them). He marries the princess (female helper, daughter of the helper). Cf. Type 315.",Closely related to Type 315; both Types are often mixed with each other or they are not clearly differentiated.,"This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 300, 315, and also 302, 303, 314, 315A, 318, 400, 531, 551, and 613.",69.0

(Including the previous Types 613*, 613A*, and 613B*). Two men (travelers, brothers, tailor and cobbler) argue (wager) [N61] about whether truth or falsehood (justice or unjustice, whose religion) is more powerful. They call on animals and people they meet to act as judges [K451.1, N92]. The loser (the one who stands for the truth) is robbed and blinded, or the wicked man shares his bread with his hungry companion only if he will let his eyes be put out [M225, N2.3.3, S165]. The blind man spends the night in (under) a tree [F1045], where he overhears secrets of birds (other animals, devils, ogres, witches) [B253, G661.1, N451.1, N452]. By means of this knowledge [H963] he is able to restore his sight [D1505.5], to cure sickness (of the princess, king) [C940.1, D2064.1, V34.2], to end drought [F933.2, H1193, N452.1], etc. [N552.1.1, D2101, H1181]. He is rewarded (marries the princess [H346]). His companion, intending to acquire the same wealth, imitates him. He goes to the same tree (sometimes also blinded), but the birds (devils) think it was he who betrayed their secrets, and tear him to pieces [N471].",,"This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 300, 326, 531, 554, 812, 954, 1535, and 1641.",121.0

This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a clever horse. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms, 'The Godchild of the King und the Unfaithful Companion', 'The Golden-haired Maiden', and 'The Clever Horse'. A poor boy goes in search of his godfather [H1381.2.2.1], the king (God, Virgin Mary, etc.) [N811]. On the way he obtains a clever magic horse that offers to help him [B211.1.3, B133, B401]. Against the horse's advice [B341] he picks up a glimmering feather (golden hair, golden horse-shoe, other bright object), which he later gives to the king. En route the boy is accompanied by a companion (devil, beardless man, Gypsy, etc.) who forces him to change places [K1934] and to swear silence. At the king's court the boy is employed as a groom. He helps different animals, who in return promise to help him [B350, B391, B470, B501]. A treacherous employee of the king (the boy's companion) slanders him to the king, saying that he had boasted he could find the bird that had lost the feather and/or to bring the golden-haired maiden (princess) as bride for the king [T11.4.1, H75.2, H1213.1, H1381.3.1.1]. On pain of death he is assigned to accomplish the dangerous tasks [H911]. He succeeds with help of his horse. The abducted princess refuses to marry the old king until she receives certain things (her castle, keys that have fallen into the sea, water of life, etc.). The boy brings these with the help of his horse and of the helpers he had met on his way (grateful animals) [H982, B450]. As the last condition for the marriage the princess demands the boy be killed (burned, beheaded, dismembered, by taking a bath in boiling milk or oil of a herd of wild mares, by water of death, etc.) The horse saves the boy or he is resuscitated by the princess, rejuvenated, and beautified [E15.1, E12, D1865.1]. The king has the same thing done to him with fatal results (the princess does not resuscitate him, he dies in the milk, etc.) [J2411.1]. The magic horse turns into a young woman (man) [B313, D131, D700]. The boy marries her (the princess) and becomes king. Cf. Type 328.","Classical origin for some motifs.

Because of his enormous appetite he is sent away from home [F612.1, F614.1]. He works for a smith but (often) injures his master [K1411, K1421, K1422], who tries to get rid of him by setting trials of strength [H931, F514.2, F612.3.1, F614.6]. The strong man has to uproot trees, to catch wolves and bears (lions, etc.), to tame devils, etc. [F613'F613.4]. When he is sent to catch wild animals [F615.2.3], he harnesses them to a coach. When he is in a well and a mill stone (bell) is thrown on him, he wears it as collar or complains that chickens are scratching dirt onto him [F615.3.1, F615.3.1.1]. When he is sent to the devil's mill (hell), he drives the devil to his master's house [F80, F615.1, H1272]. When he goes to the king to be paid, the king shoots him (in vain) with cannons. The strong man accomplishes every task and overcomes all difficulties [F615] (kills his master and finally marries).",Introduction to Type 301.,"This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 300, 301, 1000, 1063, and also 300A, 302, 326, 592, 650B, 820, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1007, 1029, 1045, 1049, 1050, 1052, 1060, 1062, 1072, 1082, 1084, 1088, 1115, 1120, 1130, 1132, 1535, 1640, 1881, and 1910.",148.0
